## As a freelance web developer, logos can get pricy when asking a graphic designer to design them for you constantly. It would be much easier to generate them through a command line application that allowed them to be customizable and easy to make!

The challenge for this homework was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file linked to an external site. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.
